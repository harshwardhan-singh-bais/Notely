# Big Data Security: An In-Depth Look

## What is Big Data Security?
Big data security is essentially the robust process of **monitoring and protecting a company’s vital business data**. The overarching goal is to ensure safe, secure, and compliant ongoing operations.

### Why is Big Data Security a Constant Concern?
Big Data deployments are inherently **valuable targets** for potential intruders due to the immense amount of sensitive information they hold. This makes them a high-priority area for security.

*   **Ransomware Attacks:** A single ransomware attack can cripple a company's big data deployment, leading to severe financial demands to regain access.
*   **Data Siphoning:** Perhaps even more concerning, unauthorized users might gain access to big data platforms to steal and sell valuable information, leading to massive data breaches and reputational damage.

### How is Big Data Security Achieved?
Securing these complex platforms requires a multi-faceted approach:
*   A blend of **traditional security tools**.
*   **Newly developed toolsets** designed for the unique challenges of big data.
*   **Intelligent processes** for continuous security monitoring throughout the platform's entire lifecycle.

## How Big Data Security Works: The Core Mission
The mission of big data security is quite straightforward: **keep unauthorized users and intrusions out**. This is accomplished using a combination of established security measures:
*   **Firewalls**
*   **Strong user authentication**
*   **End-user training**
*   **Intrusion Protection Systems (IPS)**
*   **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**

And critically, **if someone does gain access, all data must be encrypted** – both in transit and at rest.

### Beyond Traditional Network Security
While these strategies sound familiar to general network security, big data environments introduce an **additional layer of complexity**. Security tools must operate effectively across **three distinct data stages** that aren't always present in a traditional network setup:

1.  **Data Ingress:** Data coming *into* the system.
2.  **Stored Data:** Data *at rest* within the system.
3.  **Data Output:** Data *going out* to applications and reports.

## The Three Stages of Big Data Security

### Stage 1: Data Sources (Data Ingress)
This stage focuses on **what's coming in** to the big data platform.
*   **Variety of Sources and Types:** Big data originates from an incredibly diverse range of sources and data types.
*   **User-Generated Data:** This alone is vast, including:
    *   Customer Relationship Management (CRM) data.
    *   Transactional and database data.
    *   Massive amounts of unstructured data like email messages or social media posts.
*   **Machine-Generated Data:** Beyond human interaction, there's a whole world of data from machines, such as logs and sensor readings.

### Stage 2: Stored Data (Data At Rest)
Protecting the data once it's within the system is paramount.
*   **Mature Security Tool Sets:** This requires advanced tools for:
    *   **Encryption at rest**.
    *   **Strong user authentication**.
    *   **Intrusion protection and planning**.
*   **Distributed Cluster Platforms:** Companies need to deploy and run these security tool sets across complex, distributed cluster platforms, which involve many servers and nodes.
*   **Protecting Internal Components:** Security tools must also protect critical components like log files and analytics tools as they operate *inside* the platform.

### Stage 3: Output Data (Data Egress)
The output stage is where the value of big data is realized, but also where new vulnerabilities emerge.
*   **Purpose of the Platform:** The entire reason for the complexity and expense of a big data platform is to run meaningful analytics across massive volumes and diverse types of data.
*   **Valuable Output:** These analytics generate results that go out to applications, reports, and dashboards.
*   **Rich Target for Intrusion:** This "extremely valuable intelligence" makes output data a prime target for intruders. It's critical to **encrypt output data** just as rigorously as ingress data.
*   **Compliance is Key:** At this stage, it's essential to secure compliance by ensuring that results distributed to end-users **do not contain regulated data**.

## Navigating Big Data Security & Trends

A fascinating dynamic exists in the big data world:
*   **Proliferation of Big Data:** The ongoing growth of big data fuels smart technologies like IoT, AI, and Machine Learning.
*   **Consumer Data Ownership Movement:** Simultaneously, there's a growing push for consumers to own and control how their personal data is used.

### The Challenge of Sensitive Personal Data
*   **Data Collection by Technologies:** Technologies such as IoT, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and even CRM databases collect terabytes of highly sensitive personal information.
*   **Enterprise Value vs. Responsibility:** While this personal big data is invaluable for enterprises wanting to tailor products and services, it also means that **all companies and third-party vendors are held responsible** for the ethical use and management of this personal data.

## Top Trends & Tips for Getting Big Data Security Right

Here are some crucial areas companies are often missing, along with tips to improve big data security:

### 1) Update Your Cloud and Distributed Security Infrastructure
*   **Shift to Cloud/Data Fabric:** Big data growth has pushed many companies towards cloud and data fabric infrastructures for scalability.
*   **Legacy Security Principles:** Cloud security is often set up based on older, legacy principles.
*   **Misconfiguration Risk:** This can lead to misconfigured cloud security features, leaving them open to attack. **Ensure cloud security is purpose-built and correctly implemented for big data.**

### 2) Set Mobile Device Management (MDM) Policies and Procedures
*   **IoT & Mobile as Sources/Receivers:** IoT devices and other mobile technologies are both major sources and receivers of big data.
*   **Security Vulnerabilities:** However, they also present significant security vulnerabilities, especially since many are personally owned and used.
*   **Strict Policies:** Implement strict policies for how employees can interact with corporate data on personal devices.
*   **Additional Security Layers:** Add extra layers of security to manage and restrict which devices can access sensitive data.

### 3) Provide Data Security Training and Best Practices
*   **Human Factor:** Most often, big data compromises occur due to successful **phishing attacks** or other personalized attacks targeting unsuspecting employees.
*   **Employee Training:** Train employees to recognize typical socially engineered attacks and understand what they look like.
*   **Multi-Factor Authentication:** Reiterate the need for several layers of authentication security to limit who can access sensitive data storage.
