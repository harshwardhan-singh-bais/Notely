Big data concept, storage 
and management
What is Big Data?
                                    structured, semi-structured, and unstructured 
data to extract insight meaning, from which one pattern can be 
designed that will be useful to take a decision for grabbing the new 
business opportunity, the betterment of product/service, and 
ultimately business growth. Data science process to make sense of 
Big data/huge amount of data that is used in business.
Data Mining: It is a process of extracting insight meaning, hidden patterns from 
collected data that is useful to take a business decision for the purpose of decreasing 
expenditure and increasing revenue.
Big Data: This is a term related to extracting meaningful data by analyzing the huge 
amount of complex, variously formatted data generated at high speed, that cannot be 
handled, or processed by the traditional system.
Data Expansion Day by Day: Day by day amount of data increasing exponentially 
because of today's various data production sources like a smart electronic devices.

 Big Data Storage
• What is Big Data Storage?
                                    storing massive amounts of data that they could 
not keep on their servers.
The problem was that traditional storage methods couldn't handle 
storing all this data.
Big Data Storage Challenges
• The first challenge is how much storage you'll need for your extensive 
data system. 
• Another challenge with big data is how quickly it grows
Big Data Storage Key Considerations
• Data velocity: Your data must be able to move quickly between 
processing centers and databases for it to be helpful in real-time 
applications.
• Scalability: The system should be able to expand as your 
business does and accommodate new projects as needed 
without disrupting existing workflows or causing any downtime.
• Cost efficiency: Because big data projects can be so expensive, 
choosing a system that reduces costs without sacrificing the 
quality of service or functionality is essential.
 Big Data Storage Solutions
• Distributed File Systems
• NoSQL Databases: NoSQL databases, designed to handle 
unstructured and semi-structured data, provide flexibility and 
scalability beyond traditional relational databases.
• Columnar Databases: Columnar databases organize data by columns 
rather than rows, optimizing data retrieval for analytical queries.
• Cloud-Based Storage Solutions: Cloud platforms provide scalable 
and cost-effective storage options for Big Data.
