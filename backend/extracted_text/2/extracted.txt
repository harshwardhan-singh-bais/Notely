Big Data Security
Big data security is the process of monitoring and protecting a 
company’s important business data with the goal of ensuring safe and 
compliant ongoing operation. 
❖
Big data security is a constant concern because Big Data deployments are 
valuable targets to would-be intruders.
❖
A single ransomware attack might leave a company’s big data deployment 
subject to ransom demands.
❖
Even worse, an unauthorized user may gain access to a company’s big data 
to siphon off and sell valuable information.
❖
Securing big data platforms takes a mix of traditional security tools, newly 
developed toolsets, and intelligent processes for monitoring security 
throughout the life of the platform.
How Big Data Security Works
❏
Big data security’s mission is clear enough: keep out on unauthorized 
users and intrusions with firewalls, strong user authentication, end-user 
training, and intrusion protection systems (IPS) and intrusion detection 
systems (IDS).
❏
In case someone does gain access, encrypt your data in transit and at rest.
❏
This sounds like any network security strategy. However, big data 
environments add another level of security because security tools must 
operate during three data stages that are not all present in the network. 
❏
These are: data ingress, which is what’s coming in; stored data; and data 
output going out to applications and reports.
Stage 1: Data Sources. :
● Big data sources come from a variety of sources and data types. 
●User-generated data alone can include customer relationship 
management (CRM), transactional and database data, and vast 
amounts of unstructured data such as email messages or social 
media posts. 
●In addition to this, you have the whole world of 
machine-generated data including logs and sensors.
Stage 2: Stored Data : 
❏
Protecting stored data takes mature security tool sets including 
encryption at rest, strong user authentication, and intrusion protection 
and planning.
❏
 A company needs to run its security tool sets across a distributed 
cluster platform with many servers and nodes. 
❏
In addition, its security tools must protect log files and analytics tools 
as they operate inside the platform.
Stage 3: Output Data.:
●
The entire reason for the complexity and expense of the big data platform is 
so it can run meaningful analytics across massive data volumes and different 
types of data. 
●
These analytics output results to applications, reports, and dashboards. 
●
This extremely valuable intelligence makes for a rich target for intrusion, and 
it is critical to encrypt output as well as ingress.
●
 Also, secure compliance at this stage: make certain that results going out to 
end-users do not contain regulated data.
Navigating Big Data Security & Trends
❏
Two of the biggest trends in the world of big data stand somewhat in 
opposition to each other: the proliferation of big data that informs smart 
technology, and also the growing movement for consumers to own and decide 
how their personal data is being used. 
❏
Technologies like IoT, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and even 
customer relationship management (CRM) databases collect terabytes of data 
that contain highly sensitive personal information. 
❏
This personal form of big data is valuable for enterprises that want to better cater 
their products and services to their audience, but it also means that all companies 
and third-party vendors are held responsible for the ethical use and management 
of personal data.
Take a look at some of the top trends happening in the big data world, the 
important security points that many companies are missing, and some 
tips for getting big data security right:
1) Update your cloud and distributed security infrastructure:
● Big data growth has caused many companies to move toward 
cloud and data fabric infrastructures that allow for more data 
storage scalability.
●Cloud security is often established based on legacy security 
principles, and as a result, cloud security features are 
misconfigured and open to attack.
2) Set mobile device management policies and procedures
❏
IoT and other mobile devices are some of the greatest sources and 
receivers of big data, but they also offer several security vulnerabilities 
since so many of these technologies are owned and used for personal life.
 
❏
Set strict policies for how employees can engage with corporate data on 
personal devices, and be sure to set additional layers of security in order 
to manage which devices can access sensitive data.
3) Provide data security training and best practices
❏
Most often, big data is compromised as the result of a successful phishing 
attack or other personalized attack targeted at an unknowing employee. 
❏
Train your employees on typical socially engineered attacks and what they 
look like, and again, set up several layers of authentication security to limit 
who can access sensitive data storage.
Benefits Of Big Data Security
❏
Customer Retention: With big data security, a company can observe 
many data patterns, which allows them to better fit their products and 
services with their clients needs. 
❏
Risk Identification: Because of big data security, a company can use big 
data tools to identify risks in their infrastructure, helping companies 
create a risk management solution.
●
Business Innovation: Big data security can help companies update their 
tools and help transfer products into new secure systems. This innovation can 
improve business processes, marketing techniques, customer service, and 
company productivity.
●
Cost Optimization: Big data security technologies can reduce customer 
costs by efficiently storing, processing, and analyzing large volumes of data. 
Big data security tools also will calculate how the product will benefit the 
company, so companies can pick a company that is better for their 
infrastructure.
Challenges of Big Data Security
❏
Newer technologies can be vulnerable: Advanced analytic tools for 
unstructured big data and non-relational databases (NoSQL) are 
examples of newer big data technologies in active development. It can 
be difficult for security software and processes to protect these new 
toolsets.
❏
Variable impact: Mature security tools effectively protect data 
ingress and storage. However, they may not have the same impact on 
data output from multiple analytics tools to multiple locations.
❏
Access without permission: Big data administrators may decide to mine 
data without permission or notification. Whether the motivation is curiosity 
or criminal profit, your security tools need to monitor and alert on suspicious 
access no matter where it comes from.
❏
Beyond routine audits: The sheer size of a big data installation, terabytes to 
petabytes large, is too big for routine security audits. And because most big 
data platforms are cluster-based, this introduces multiple vulnerabilities 
across multiple nodes and servers.
❏
Requires constant updates: If the big data owner does not regularly update 
security for the environment, they are at risk of data loss and exposure.
